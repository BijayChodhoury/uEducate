            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">History of Education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to
                education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of
                technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in
                developing countries. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures
                through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

                The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a
                stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely
                available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.</p>
